# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This a web application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course developed by me.
For the front-end template used React, HTML and CSS. Used BooksAPI.js for backed server which is provided by the Udacity.
## TL;DR

To run this application right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

```


## Backend Server

We've provided a backend server from udacity to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
